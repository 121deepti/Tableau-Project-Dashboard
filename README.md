# Elevating Healthcare Analysis:Advancing Healthcare Analysis through Data Insights
As a data analyst at HealthStat Solutions, specializing in healthcare analytics. Tasked with analyzing two datasets:<b>'Patient Medical Records'and 'Hospital Treatment Details'</b>. The
former contains detailed <b>patient information</b>, while the latter provides insights into <b>hospital treatments</b>. 
I utilized <b>Tableau's</b> capabilities to extract insights that enhance patient care and hospital operations. This involves meticulous data preparation, intelligent modeling, and
leveraging Tableau's functions for analysis.The end goal is to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that communicates key findings,driving actionable insights for optimized hospital performance.
